# odin-recipes
A project where we use all of our HTML knowledge we've acquired. We are essentially making a basic website which contains recipes on our index page with links to other recipes. 

Skills demonstrated: HTML, proper use of anchor attributes for links and images.

What I learned: When to add absolute links when adding images, relative links when adding other web pages within our directory, properly using different heading sizes, properly using ordered and unordered lists.
